### Weatherproof housing

Your electronics and camera should be **protected from the elements**. That is where the housing comes in.

Some all sky camera designs are based on a **fully closed system**. No moisture in or out, no air in or out. We believe this to be **wrong**. And we’ll try and explain why we think that.

In some environments, the **temperature** within an all sky housing during the day can **vary greatly**. From temperatures below zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at nighttime to temperatures of over 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) at daytime. 

In fully closed housings, this creates **significant pressure differences**, which will eventually **end up breaking seals**. It will also affect how your environment sensor reacts and **incorrectly reads** your environmental situation.

Your electronics and your camera will also **suffer** from these vast differences between night and day.

If we **open up** our enclosure to the outside environment in a **controlled manner** and we introduce a **fan to circulate the air** within the housing, we have a much better control of the temperatures inside the housing and we **eliminate the pressure differences**. Additionally, we will have a **better ‘feel’** with the outside environment from our environment sensor.

To connect your waterproof setup via PoE, we can recommend using an [IP68 rated ethernet panel connector](https://titanastro.com/store/IP68-CAT6-Waterproof-Panel-Connector-p728229377).
