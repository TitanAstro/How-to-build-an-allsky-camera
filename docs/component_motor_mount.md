For the stepper motor and bulley and pelt (ok, I know it's pulley and belt) system to correctly fit with the camera, some sort of motor mount is needed. This is actually pretty simple to make.

If you use the GT2 pulley and belt kit, the optimal distance between the pulleys from center to center is 38mm.

For your convenience, there is a [mounting plate design](https://github.com/TitanAstro/3D-Resources/raw/refs/heads/main/Stepper%20Mounting%20plate.step) on our GitHub which you can make from virtually anything: wood, a sheet of plastic, sheet metal or 3D printed.  This mounting plate is designed to fit around a ZWO camera (51mm diameter) and the [**28BYJ48** stepper motor](https://titanastro.com/store/28BYJ48-5V-Stepper-motor-p692220361).
