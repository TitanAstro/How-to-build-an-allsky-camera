### Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a so-called small Single-Board Computer (SBC), the heart of your all sky system. It runs the software and your camera will be connected to it. The Pi will be recording the images from the camera and will take care of creating your time-lapse videos, keograms, startrails and images.

Many people choose the [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) since it is a very dependable mini-computer with a relatively low power consumption.

However, the [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) in combination with a [Titan Astro SkyCamOne HAT](https://titanastro.com/store/SkyCamOne-HATs-c173503509) will make it possible to use NVMe memory device in the form of an M.2 SSD drive. These drives are fast, very reliable and have large storage capacity. If you require this for your build, the [Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) is the way to go.
