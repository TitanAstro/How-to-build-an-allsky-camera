### Servo motor and dome cover

A servo motor is another type of positional actuator. Normally servo motors have a range of motion of around 180 degrees. They are usually very lightweight and strong because of the way the internal mechanism is designed. Servos work with a simple PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal, which your SkyCamOne HAT provides through the servo connector.

A servo is perfect for a dome cover, in particular for the clamshell type dome covers. The below design is by Wichie Rivera.
