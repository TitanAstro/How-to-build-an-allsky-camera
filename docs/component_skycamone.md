HAT stands for **Hardware Attached on Top** and in this case it refers to the fact that the [SkyCamOne cards](https://titanastro.com/store/SkyCamOne-HATs-c173503509) attach on top of a Raspberry Pi 4B or 5 like in the adjacent picture.

The SkyCamOne HATs work as an **extra layer of hardware** to the Raspberry Pi, enabling the Raspberry Pi to **host a list of features** that we **commonly use** in all sky camera builds.

One important feature is the **power supply** circuit of the [SkyCamOne HAT](https://titanastro.com/store/SkyCamOne-HATs-c173503509). It simplifies powering the camera and different internal systems. One can power the complete camera with **just a network cable** or a **single 12 volt** cable going into the housing.

Another feature is the interface for **two stepper motors**. Stepper motors can be used to aid in **focusing** the camera or changing the **height** of our camera within the dome.

It also provides an interface for a **servo motor**, the same ones used in model cars and airplanes, which we could use to activate a dome cover for instance.

Furthermore, the [SkyCamOne HATs](https://titanastro.com/store/SkyCamOne-HATs-c173503509) have interfaces for **I2C sensors**, a **fan controller** for active cooling, a **dew heater** output and in case of the HAT for Raspberry Pi 5 an **SSD slot** for storage memory.

Using a [SkyCamOne HAT](https://titanastro.com/store/SkyCamOne-HATs-c173503509) **takes away the necessity to create custom electronic circuits**, having to debug and having to reinvent the wheel. You can directly connect your stepper motor, servo, sensors and dew heater **without** the need for **additional electronics**.
