### Transparent dome



To protect your camera from the elements but still provide good visibility with a minimum of distortion, we use transparent domes.

Usually, the type of dome you see on your local supermarket ceiling, with a CCTV camera in it. 

In most cases, a 3″ or [4″ diameter dome](https://titanastro.com/store/Dome-4-diameter-CCTV-clear-acrylic-p698624616) is used. The lens of your camera should be placed just **above** the **center** of your dome to minimize optical distortions from the extrusion of the acrylic.

High end cameras use silicon (glass) domes with an Anti-Reflective (AR) coating on the inside. These are costly and because most do not have a flange they are harder to mount and keep sealed.
