In order for your all sky system to know what the environment is doing as far as temperature and humidity go, we need some sort of sensor. With the SkyCamOne HATs you can use any type of I2C sensor. A very reliable sensor that is protected from the adverse effects of moisture, is the [SHT31-D](https://titanastro.com/store/Temphum-sensor-SHT31D-I2C-QWIIC-p692557720). This sensor measures temperature and humidity with a very high precision and even has a built-in heater!

Other sensors that work well are the BME280 or BME680.

Most of these sensors nowadays use a standard cable called a [QWIIC-cable](https://titanastro.com/store/QWIIC-I2C-Sensor-connection-Cable-p692223382). These are used by many sensor manufacturers including SparkFun and AdaFruit, but they are also the standard cable used by the SkyCamOne HATs.
