### Camera and lens

This one is a tricky combination. Depending on which camera you choose, you choose your lens. Not all cameras work well with all lenses and vice versa. 

You will also want a near horizon-to-horizon field of view for your all sky camera, and a wide angle lens just does not give the same result with a small camera sensor size as it does with a large sensor size.

A commonly used lens is the [1.55mm f2 CS mount fisheye lens](https://titanastro.com/store/1-2-1-55mm-F2-0-IR-CS-mount-fisheye-lens-185-degree-FoV-p728243754). With a 1/2″ camera sensor this lens will provide a full view of the sky with a complete image circle. However, with a 1/3″ sensor you will have an image that will be slightly clipped on the top and bottom.

Commonly used cameras are the [Raspberry Pi HQ](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) camera, [ZWO planetary cameras](https://www.zwoastro.com/product-category/cameras/planetary_cameras/) or [QHY cameras](https://www.qhyccd.com/planetary-camera-qhy5iii485c/).
