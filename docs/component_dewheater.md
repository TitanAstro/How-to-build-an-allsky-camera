### Dew heater

Your camera sits under the **protective acrylic or glass dome**. It **protects your camera** from the elements, from sand and dust in the air, from bird droppings, you name it.

Unfortunately, in most environments it also introduces a problem: **dew**.

Dew is actually **moisture in the air** that condenses on relatively cold surfaces under certain circumstances. These circumstances include favorable values for air temperature and relative humidity of this same air.

The **formula** for this, as proposed by Mark G. Lawrence is as follows:
$$
Td = T - ((100 - RH)/5)
$$
Td is the dew point (temperature), T is the temperature and RH is the Relative Humidity.

So, if the relative humidity of the air surrounding my camera is 68% and the temperature is 15 degrees Celsius, then the dew point is 15 – (100 – 68)/5 or 15 – 32/5 = 8,6 degrees Celsius.

So, whenever we reach 8,6 degrees Celsius, we can expect **dew to form on anything**. We can **mitigate** this by just **making sure we do not reach** 8,6 degrees Celsius. How, you ask? By **heating up!**

We can place a so called **dew heater inside our dome**. A dew heater is generally an **array of** small **resistors** that heat up when current runs through them. This maintains the air in that dome nice and warm, or at least well above the dew point temperature. By doing that, we will **not have any dew** in our dome and we’ll have good views of the sky all the time.

Another advantage of a dew heater is that it will help us **dry up rain drops** faster and will also help **melt snow** or hail that has fallen on our dome and obstructs our view.
