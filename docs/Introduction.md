## Introduction

An **all sky camera** is a **specialised device** that records or photographs as much of the **night sky** as possible, from dusk till dawn.

After the night ends, early morning, you will find that your camera has produced a **time-lapse video** of the entire night. Possibly also a **keogram** or a **star trail**.

Usually, this type of camera is used for **meteor detection**, for **aurora borealis** recording, for recording other **astronomical phenomenae** or just for **personal fun**.

With this guide, we have tried to make it as **complete and comprehensive** as possible. Hopefully, as a single resource containing **everything you need to know** about building your own DIY all sky camera!
