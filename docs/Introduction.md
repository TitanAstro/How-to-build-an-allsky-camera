**A comprehensive guide**  

This is a living, breathing document. We will update this Wiki regularly with new information and new insights.

## Introduction {#introduction}

An **all sky camera** is a **specialised device** that records or photographs as much of the **night sky** as possible, from dusk till dawn.

After the night ends, early morning, you will find that your camera has produced a **time-lapse video** of the entire night. Possibly also a **keogram** or a **star trail**.

Usually, this type of camera is used for **meteor detection**, for **aurora borealis** recording, for recording other **astronomical phenomenae** or just for **personal fun**.

With this guide, we have tried to make it as **complete and comprehensive** as possible. Hopefully, as a single resource containing **everything you need to know** about building your own DIY all sky camera!

## Requirements {#requirements}

Generally speaking, an all sky camera should have the following requirements:

- it needs to record as much of the sky as possible, with as much details as possible
- it should have a light sensitive camera so it works in very low light conditions
- it should be autonomous
- it should be weather proof
- it should be remotely accessible

## Components needed - shopping list {#shoppinglist}

For a complete all sky camera setup that is autonomous and permanently placed outside, you would roughly need the following components:

- A Raspberry [Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) or [Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/)
- [a SkyCamOne HAT](https://titanastro.com/store/SkyCamOne-HATs-c173503509)
- a camera with [lens](https://titanastro.com/store/1-2-1-55mm-F2-0-IR-CS-mount-fisheye-lens-185-degree-FoV-p728243754)
- a weatherproof housing
- a [transparent dome](https://titanastro.com/store/Dome-4-diameter-CCTV-clear-acrylic-p698624616)
- a power supply
- a [dew heater](https://titanastro.com/store/Dew-heaters-c176908335)
- an [environment sensor](https://titanastro.com/store/Temphum-sensor-SHT31D-I2C-QWIIC-p692557720) and [cable](https://titanastro.com/store/QWIIC-I2C-Sensor-connection-Cable-p692223382)

Optionally, you could equip your camera with a focus mechanism. For this you would need some additional items:

- a [stepper motor](https://titanastro.com/store/28BYJ48-5V-Stepper-motor-p692220361) and a [belt and pulley set](https://titanastro.com/store/GT2-Focus-Kit-Pulleys-and-belt-p696697425)
- some sort of mounting of the motor to the lens

And lastly, you could use a dome cover to protect your dome and camera from the sun during the day or from rain. For that, you would need:

- a [servo motor](https://titanastro.com/store/SG90-Micro-Servo-p692218128)
- some sort of dome cover

Weâ€™ll discuss these components in more detail.
